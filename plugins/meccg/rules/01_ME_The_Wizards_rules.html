			<br><a name="Introduction"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
			<br>
During the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to
unite and counsel the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron,
the Dark Lord. However, they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of
Middle-earth or to match the power of Sauron with power. These five
were known as "Wizards" (also called Istari) in Middle-earth, and
individually they were called: Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and
Pallando.<br>  
			In <i>Middle-earth: The Wizards</i>,
you play one of these five Wizards. Your goal is to marshal the forces
of the Free Peoples so that Sauron can be resisted until the One Ring
is destroyed. Since your fellow Wizards do not agree on how best to
accomplish this goal, you must battle for the minds, bodies, and souls
of the Free Peoples.<br> In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf was the only
Wizard to succeed. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast "went
native," and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East. Only
Gandalf remained true to his task, marshalling the characters and
forces that withstood Sauron long enough for the Fellowship to destroy
the Ruling Ring.<br>
"Evil forces" are represented by hazards that the players use against
one another. For example, if you move a character into Moria, your
opponent could play a Troll card as a hazard. These hazards are not
"controlled" by the Wizards, but rather they represent the forces of
Sauron, who himself is in a "dormant" or hiding phase. All players are
"good," so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to
"persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and
forces, rather than the form of direct conflict.<br>  <br><i>Note:
For purposes of readability, these rules use the standard masculine
pronouns when referring to a person of uncertain gender. In such cases,
these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings: she/he, him/her,
etc.</i><br>

			These rules are organized into four sections: the Starter Rules, the Standard
			Rules, the Optional Rules, and the Appendices. The Starter and Standard
			Rules are for a two-player game; multi-player rules are provided in the
			Optional Rules. <br>
			The introductory material on pages 4-8 provides a brief player turn summary,
			player notes, and definitions of commonly used terms.<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Starter Rules - </b>The Starter Rules contain all of the guidelines
			you need to play METW. They have been designed to simplify teaching the
			game and to speed up play. You should use the Starter Rules if you and your
			opponent have never played this game before or if one of you only has access
			to a starter deck. <br>
			If you are already an experienced player of collectible card games, you
			might read the next couple of pages and the sections that are not boxed.
			As you play, you can refer to the other material that details the more complex
			rules and situations that may arise during play. <br>
			<br>
			<b>The Standard Rules -</b> These rules assume you have already played several
			games using the Starter Rules. The Standard Rules consist of additions and
			extensions to the Starter Rules that make play and deck building more flexible,
			exciting, and interesting. We recommend that experienced METW players use
			all of the Standard Rules.<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Optional Rules - </b>Interesting variations to the standard rules.
			Before play begins, both players must agree on which optional rules are
			to be used.<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Appendices -</b> An index, credits, keys, the Full Player Turn Summary.
			The color insert includes a map and a key to the cards. <br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="BriefPlayerTurnSummary"></a>Brief Player Turn Summary</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Play consists of a series of "Player Turns." During your turn,
			follow the steps outlined in this turn summary. Then, your opponent does
			the same during his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the
			game ends. This turn summary is included here to give you an idea of how
			play proceeds; see p. 68-70 for the Full Player Turn Summary.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Untap Phase -</b> Each of your characters may do one of the following:
			Untap or Heal (if at a Haven site). In addition, untap (see page 15) all
			of your other tapped non-site cards.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Organization Phase -</b> You may take the following actions in any order:
			play one character (if allowed) or your Wizard (if available), reorganize
			your companies, transfer items between characters (corruption checks required),
			and store items (corruption checks required). In addition, each of your
			companies may plan its movement by playing a new site card face down on
			its present site card.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Long-event Phase -</b> Discard your resource long-events and your opponent's
			hazard long-events. Play new resource long-event cards. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Movement/Hazard Phase -</b> One at a time, each of your companies takes
			the following actions. The company turns over its new site card (if it has
			one); its current site becomes its site of origin. If the company moved
			to a non-Haven site, you may draw up to the # of cards indicated by the
			site that it is moving to (at least one card must be draw); your opponent
			does the same. If the company is moving to a Haven site, you may draw up
			to the # of cards indicated by the site that you are moving from (at least
			one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. Next, your opponent
			may play allowable hazard cards on the company; the maximum number of hazards
			that may be played on a company is equal to the size of the company (to
			a minimum of two). Finally, remove the site of origin card and each player
			discards or draws so that he has eight cards in his hand. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Site Phase -</b> One at a time, each of your companies may take the following
			actions at its current, untapped site. The company decides to enter and
			explore the site. First, if the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks
			the company. Then, the company may attempt to play one item, ally, faction,
			or information resource card that is "playable" at that site.
			A character in the company must tap to make this attempt. If the card is
			successfully played, tap the site.<br>
			<br>
			<b>End-of-Turn Phase -</b> Each player may discard one card. Then each player
			must draw or discard so that his hand has eight cards. <br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="PlayerNotes"></a>Player Notes </font>

			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Site cards (and region cards in the Standard Game) represent the geography
			of Middle-earth. They are used to control the acquisition of resources,
			but they should not direct play. Instead, a player should examine the resources
			in his hand and then select a nearby site to travel to. Initially, do not
			worry too much about which site to use, just pick one that has the resource
			type you want to play. It also helps if you preselect the location cards
			you are most likely to use when you put together a play deck. </li>
			<li>In METW you will draw multiple cards each turn, and in some cases you
			will have to discard a number of cards each turn. Don't let this worry
			you, it's part of the flow of play. Just keep cards that are immediately
			useful during the next turn or that are crucial to your overall strategy
			(i.e., your primary resource acquisition strategy). </li>
			<li>Notes For Players of other Collectible Card Games </li>
			<li>If you have played other collectible card games (CCG), there are several
			key factors to keep in mind: </li>
			<li>METW is less tactical and more strategic than some other CCGs. There
			is combat, but it is not the dominant focus of the game. </li>
			<li>The players in METW are in direct competition with each other to marshal
			resources. However, only hazards directly attack the players' characters
			and they are handled in a less controlled fashion (e.g., they are only
			played during your opponent's movement/hazard phase, hazard creatures do
			not remain in play, etc.). </li>
			<li>For timing purposes, all cards in METW are played and tapped with the
			same "speed" (effects take place instantly). But, a player may
			only play resource cards during his own turn, and a player may only play
			hazard cards during his opponent's movement/hazard phase. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><i>Clarification: The card, Twilight, is an exception to this rule-it
			can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard (it does not
			count against the hazard limit). Certain other cards specifically state
			when they may be played.</i><br> <br>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ol>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>If your Wizard is "eliminated" (i.e., through combat or corruption)-your

<font face="Garamond">			<li>When each play deck has been exhausted once, the council starts at

			<li>After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may
			choose to call the council at the end of any of your turns. The council
			starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets
			one last turn). </li>
			<li>You may choose to call the council at the end of your turn if you have
			accumulated at least 20 marshalling points. The council starts at the end

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">THE FREE COUNCIL</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check.
			The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters
			first. <br>
			At the Free Council, the leaders of the Free Peoples decide which Wizard's
			advice is best to follow. This is based upon a comparison of the resources
			each of the Wizards has marshalled. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Clarification</b>: Characters do not automatically untap when the

			phase.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: A character that fails his corruption check prior
			to the Free Council is no longer in play. That character and any non-follower
			cards he controls are not available at the Free Council-thus, they do not
			count towards the marshalling point totals. <br>
			A player may play resource cards that can affect his characters' corruption
			checks made prior to the Free Council. Hazard cards may not be played.<br>
			After all characters have made their corruption checks, the game ends if
			one Wizard has failed his corruption check (the other player wins). If both
			Wizards fail their corruption checks, no one wins-both players lose (if

			Since Jessica called the council, Jason gets one final turn before the council
			starts. Jason brings Éomer into play for one more MP, and then moves
			his company to Lake-town. After facing the hazards Jessica plays, he successfully
			plays the Men of Northern Rhovanion faction for two more MPs. Jason now
			has 17 MPs and will win the game if he does not lose any MPs due to characters
			failing corruption checks.<br>
			In this example, any character with 2 or more CPs could fail his corruption
			check (see pages 35-36). If Pallando fails his corruption check, the game
			ends immediately and Jason wins. If Legolas fails his corruption check,
			Jessica loses 2 of her MPs. If Théoden fails his corruption check,
			Jason loses 6 of his MPs. If Faramir fails his corruption check, Jason loses
			2 of his MPs. <br>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">2 · The Cards and Decks</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">There are five types of cards: site cards, character cards (including
			Wizard cards), resource cards, hazard cards, and region cards (this last
			type is not used with the Starter Rules). <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> The card types can be distinguished as follows:</i>
			</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Site cards</b> - have a white parchment background on the front.
			</li>
			<li><b>Character cards</b> - (non-Wizard) have a blue stone background
			on the front. Each Wizard card has a differently colored stone background.
			</li>
			<li><b>Resource cards</b> - have a copper metal background on the front.
			</li>
			<li><b>Hazard cards</b> - have a steel gray metal background on the front.
			</li>
			<li><b>Region cards</b> - have a labeled map on the front. </li>
			<li><b>Site and region cards</b> - (i.e., location cards) have an unlabeled
			map of northwestern Middle-earth on the back. </li>
			<li><b>Character, resource, and hazard cards</b> - have the burning eye
			on the back. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: For emphasis, a value used during play
			is often provided both in a card's text and in another place on the same
			card. For example, a character's corruption check modification is stated
			both in the text and the lower right corner of the character's card.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Note</b>: Each starter deck has a small pack of cards called a fixed
			set. There are 5 fixed sets in all. One appears randomly in each starter
			deck. The top facing card of all fixed sets is Gates of Morning. </i><br>A
			fixed set is included in each starter deck to make a starter deck playable
			without any other cards.<br>
			During play, your cards are organized into 2 decks and 3 piles: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Location Deck</b> - This deck consists of your site cards. You may
			examine and select cards from your location deck as required by play (i.e.,
			do not randomly draw them). After being played, your non-Haven site cards
			are sometimes discarded and placed in the discard pile (i.e., when one
			of your companies leaves a tapped site, it is discarded). </li>
			<li><b>Play Deck</b> - This deck consists of your resource cards, hazards
			cards, and character cards. You randomly draw cards from this deck during
			play. Your play deck starts with an equal number of resource cards and
			hazard cards. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You can use resources at certain sites and under certain conditions.
			Resources include: items, factions, allies, events, etc. You may only play
			resource cards during your own turn. You use hazards to hinder and attack
			your opponent's characters in order to prevent them from marshalling resources.
			<i>You may only play hazard cards during your opponent's movement/hazard
			phase</i>.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The card, Twilight, is an exception
			to this rule-it can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard
			(it does not count against the hazard limit). Certain other cards specifically
			state when they may be played.</i><br> </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Discard Pile</b> - Your discarded cards are placed face down in
			your discard pile. When your play deck is exhausted, location cards in
			your discard pile are returned to your location deck. You shuffle the other
			cards in your discard pile and they become your new play deck. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br>Clarification: Your play deck is "exhausted" when you draw
			its last card. Some cards require that your play deck be manipulated and
			then reshuffled-this does not "exhaust" your play deck.<br>
			<br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Out-of-play Pile</b> - Your cards that are removed from play after
			being used are placed in your out-of-play pile. </li>
			<li><b>Marshalling Point Pile</b> (MP pile) - In addition to marshalling
			points from cards in play, you gain marshalling points when certain cards
			are removed from play. When you defeat all of the strikes from a creature,
			the creature's card is placed in your MP pile. When you store certain resource
			cards (e.g., items, information cards, etc.), they are placed in your MP
			pile. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Note</i></b><i>: Because hazard cards are distinct from resource
			cards, you may not play your hazards on your side of the playing surface.
			At the end of a game, it will be obvious whose cards are whose, i.e., hazards
			in your area must belong to your opponent. We suggest adopting a neutral
			zone between each player's side of the playing surface. Non-targeted long-events
			and permanent-events can be played in this neutral zone.<br>
			<b>Note</b>: You may freely examine the contents of your discard pile; your
			opponent may not. The contents of your out-of-play and marshalling point
			piles may be freely examined by you and your opponent.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: If a character is eliminated due to combat or due
			to failing a corruption check by 2 or more, his card is placed in the out-of-play
			pile-that character may not be brought back into play by either player.
			If a creature is defeated, its card is placed in the defender's marshalling
			point pile. If such a creature is unique, it may not be brought back into
			play by either player. <br>
			When a card is removed from play in all other cases, the card is discarded
			unless the card specifically states otherwise.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Several types of cards are referred to by the key
			word included in the first few words of a card's text. For example, the
			text of a "spell" card starts with spell; the text of a "Nazgûl"
			card starts with Unique. Nazgûl; the text of a "Palantír"
			starts with Unique. Palantír. </i><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">CARD COMBINATIONS</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Often combinations of several cards and other actions are required to
			achieve a desired result. For example, to bring The One Ring into play requires:
			traveling to a site to play one of the Gold Ring cards, some sort of "Test"
			card or ability, The One Ring card, and a high die roll. In addition, the
			Wizard's Test card and the Scroll of Isildur card will dramatically improve
			the chances of successfully getting The One Ring into play. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">TAPPING AND CARD POSITIONS</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Normally, during play, each of your cards is placed on the playing surface
			so that its top is towards your opponent and its bottom is towards you.
			During play certain cards must be "tapped" when they are used-this
			is a record keeping mechanism to keep track of card usage. To tap a card,
			rotate it 90° so that it is turned sideways-to untap a card, rotate
			it back 90° to its normal position. <br>
			When one of your characters is wounded, his card is placed with its top
			towards you (i.e., rotated 180° from an untapped position). All restrictions
			to tapped characters also apply to wounded characters.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: A tapped (or wounded) character can
			perform any action that does not require the character to tap. <br>
			For example, a tapped (or wounded) character can move normally, he can fight
			with a penalty (if the attacker chooses him as the target of a strike),
			he can transfer items, etc. A tapped (or wounded) character may not tap
			to acquire an item, to influence a faction, to play a card requiring that
			he tap, etc. <br>
			Items and characters tap independently.</i><br> </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">UNIQUE &amp; "MAY NOT BE DUPLICATED" CARDS</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">If a card states that it is "unique" or that it "may not
			be duplicated," only one such card (or its effects) may be in play
			at a time. The first card played takes precedence (influence checks may
			change this). This restriction applies to all cards in play, i.e., both
			yours and your opponent's. <br>
			Only one of each "unique" card may be included in your play deck
			and starting cards combined. As an exception, two of the same Wizard may
			be included in your play deck (to give you a better chance of drawing one
			early). <br>
			</font></p>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">3 · Getting Ready to Play</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Follow these steps to get ready to play: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ol>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Place your site cards in your location deck. This deck should contain
			all of your Haven cards (i.e., Rivendell, Edhellond, Grey Havens, and Lórien).
			You may include any number of Haven cards, but only one of each non-Haven
			site card. </li>
			<li>Place between 25 and 50 Resource cards and an equal number of Hazard
			cards in your play deck (if you have fewer than 25 of either available,
			just use all of the cards you have). Only one of each "unique"
			card may be included. No more than three copies of any one non-unique card
			may be included. </li>
			<li>Place one to five starting characters (no Wizards) face down in front
			of you. The combined mind attributes (see page 19) of these characters
			must be 20 or less. You and your opponent reveal your characters simultaneously,
			placing any duplicated characters into your play decks. Then organize your
			starting characters into followers and companies and place them at Rivendell
			(i.e., place a Rivendell site card next to them). </li>
			<li>You may assign up to two non-unique minor items to your starting characters
			(i.e., two items total, not two to each character). These items must come
			from cards that you have not already committed to your play deck. </li>
			<li>Place up to 10 character cards in your play deck. Only one of each
			character card may be included. In addition, place up to two Wizard cards
			in your play deck (you may place two copies of the same Wizard). Shuffle
			your play deck. </li>
			<li>Draw a hand of eight cards from your play deck. </li>
			<li>Each player makes a roll, and the player with the highest result goes
			first (reroll if tied). </li>
			</font></ol>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: None of your starting characters
			may be considered to be followers for the purposes of determining their
			combined mind attributes-your initial characters have to have combined mind
			attributes of 20 or below.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: The initial 1-5 characters and two minor items do
			count toward the "one-unique" and "three-others" limits
			on the play deck. However, they do not count towards the number of resource
			and character cards in your starting play deck.</i><br> <br>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">4 · The Player Turn</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Play consists of a series of "Player Turns." During your turn,
			you take various actions during the following phases. Then, your opponent
			does the same during his turn. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ol>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Untap Phase </li>
			<li>Organization Phase </li>
			<li>Long-event Phase </li>

			<li>End-of-Turn Phase </li>
			</font></ol>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">A Brief Player Turn Summary is presented on page 4. A detailed Full Player
			Turn Summary is presented on pages 68-70.<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The actions that may be taken during
			your organization phase may be taken in any order. Actions of the same type
			do not have to be taken together (e.g., you can store an item, then bring
			a character into play, and then store a second item). <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: If one of your companies doesn't move, neither player
			draws cards based on that company's movement. However, your opponent can
			play still play allowable hazards on that company (hazard limit still applies).<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Each player draws cards when each company moves and
			then discards or draws to 8 cards after the company has completed movement.
			Additionally, at the end of each turn, each player can discard one card
			and then discard or draw to 8 cards. <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: During the site phase, a company may decide not to
			enter and explore its current site. In this case, the company does not face
			the automatic-attack, but it may not take any other actions or play any
			cards during the site phase. The company remains at the site and it may
			decide to enter and explore the site on a later turn.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Before a company can attempt to play one item, ally,
			faction, or information resource card that is "playable" at its
			current site, it must face the site's automatic-attacks. The company need
			not defeat the attacks, it merely needs to resolve the attacks normally
			(such attacks can be canceled).<br>
			A company can face a site's automatic-attacks and still not play an item,
			ally, faction, or information resource card (e.g., all of its characters
			are tapped after facing the automatic-attacks). If such a company wants
			to play a card at the site on a later turn, it must face the automatic-attacks
			again.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: A site is tapped when one item, ally, faction, or
			information card is played. Non-Haven sites only untap after being discarded
			and after your play deck is exhausted. So, each time through your play deck,
			only one such card may normally be played at a given non-Haven site. Haven
			cards, whether tapped or not, always return to your location deck.</i><br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="CharactersCompanies"></a></font>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">5 · Characters &amp; Companies</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">As a player, you influence and control a number of characters that move
			and act in the world of Middle-earth. Each character's abilities are defined
			by these attributes: race, skills, direct influence, prowess (offense),
			body (defense), mind, marshalling points, and special abilities (e.g., corruption
			check modifiers). A character can be eliminated and removed from play as
			a result of combat (failing a body check) or corruption (failing a corruption
			check). <br>
			If you have enough general influence or direct influence during a given
			turn, you may bring into play: one character at his home site or at any
			Haven or your Wizard at his home site or Rivendell. <br>
			Characters are primarily controlled by your pool of 20 general influence
			points. For each controlled character, you must commit a number of general
			influence points equal to his mind attribute. In addition, you may control
			a character by using another character's direct influence-a character controlled
			in this fashion is called a follower and does not use general influence
			points. (See page 21 for an extended example.)<br>
			During play, you may organize your characters into groups called companies.
			A company's size is equal to the number of characters in it, with each Hobbit
			character only counting half (round up). A company is limited to a size
			of seven. A company's hazard limit is equal to two or the size of the company,
			whichever is greater. The maximum number of hazards that can be played on
			a company during a given movement/hazard phase is equal to its hazard limit.
			<br>
			Companies can only combine at a Haven-just remove all but one of the companies'
			Haven site cards. The resulting company then has one site card consisting
			of one Haven site card. <br>
			One company can split into two or more companies only at a Haven (use two
			Haven cards). <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Note</i></b><i>: The number of characters you have in play limits
			the number of actions you may take during a given turn. You use your Wizard's
			general influence or your other characters' direct influence on a character
			to bring that character into play and to keep it in play. A character in
			play can move and take actions (e.g., defending against attacks, influencing,
			etc.). Items, allies, and other cards representing things a character acquires
			and controls are placed under his card. </i><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Each character's abilities are defined by the following attributes (the
			notation for certain attributes is given in brackets). </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Race</b>: This is one criterion for using certain resources and
			for bringing certain items, characters, and factions into play (e.g., only
			a Dwarf can fully utilize a Dwarven Ring). The races are: Elf, Hobbit,
			Dwarf, Dúnadan, Man, and Wizard. </li>
			<li><b>Skills</b>: This is one of the criterion for using certain cards
			(e.g., warrior skill is required to use certain weapons). The skills are:
			warrior, scout, ranger, sage, and diplomat. Some characters have more than
			one skill. </li>
			<li><b>Direct Influence</b> [ i ]: A character's direct influence determines
			how many of your characters he may control (i.e., have as followers). In
			addition, a character's unused direct influence affects his chances of
			influencing factions and your opponent's resources. </li>
			<li><b>Prowess</b> [lower left, to left of "/"]: A character's
			prowess is a measure of a character's offensive capabilities in combat.
			</li>
			<li><b>Body</b> [lower left, to right of "/"]: A character's
			body is a measure of how difficult it is to physically eliminate the character.
			This is a mixture of the ability to avoid an attack and the ability to
			absorb or deflect an attack (e.g., armor, shield, blocking). </li>
			<li><b>Mind</b> [ m ]: A character's mind determines how many influence
			points (a Wizard's general influence points or a character's direct influence
			points) are required to keep this character in play. </li>
			<li><b>Marshalling Points</b> [ upper left ]: This is the number of marshalling
			points you receive when you have the character in play. This value represents
			the character's importance to the Free Peoples' struggle against Sauron.
			</li>
			<li><b>Special Abilities</b>: Some characters have special abilities that
			are detailed on their cards. Common special abilities include corruption
			check modifiers, influence bonuses, prowess bonuses. For example, Faramir
			has an influence bonus against the Rangers of Ithilien faction, Éowyn
			has a prowess bonus against Nazgûl, Frodo has a corruption check
			modifier, etc. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">INFLUENCING (CONTROLLING) A CHARACTER</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You have a pool of 20 general influence points. At any one time, the
			total mind attributes of your characters in play (not counting followers)
			must be less than or equal to 20; this total is equal to your used general
			influence points. Your unused general influence points help your characters
			resist the effects of certain cards (e.g., Call of Home, Call of the Sea,
			Muster Disperses, etc.).<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Note</i></b><i>: In the Standard Rules, your unused general influence
			points help your characters, factions, allies, and items resist influence
			attempts made by your opponent.</i><br>
			<br><b>Direct Influence</b><br>
			Some characters have a direct influence attribute of one or more. If such
			a character's direct influence is greater than or equal to another one of
			your characters' mind attribute, he may take control of that other character,
			who then becomes a follower of the controlling character. These conditions
			must be met: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>The total mind attributes of all of a character's followers may not
			exceed his direct influence. </li>
			<li>A character can take control of another character that is in play only
			if both characters are at the same site. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">A follower does not require influence points from your general pool.
			The follower must remain stacked under the character exerting the direct
			influence at all times. A follower may not use his direct influence to control
			characters (i.e., a follower may not have his own followers). <i>A follower
			is handled in all other ways as a normal character </i>(e.g., counts for
			company size, takes normal actions , etc.).<br>
			If you have enough unused general influence points, you may move a follower
			from direct influence to general influence (or vice versa) during your organization
			phase. <br>
			If a character directly influencing a follower is removed from play, the
			follower remains in play and does not immediately count against general
			influence. However, during your next organization phase, you must discard
			the follower, place the follower under the control of another character
			in his company with enough available direct influence, or place the follower
			under the control of general influence (if enough is available). <br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: In this example and later examples, the notation "#·#"
			is used. The first number is the character's mind attribute; the second
			is his direct influence (DI). You have nine characters you want to control:
			Gandalf (- ·10), Aragorn II (9·3), Boromir II (4·1), Legolas
			(6·2), Gimli (6·2), Frodo (5·1), Sam (4·0), Merry (4·1),
			and Pippin (4·1). In addition, Aragorn II has Narsil (+1 to direct
			influence), Frodo has The One Ring (+5 to direct influence), and Gandalf
			has a Lesser Ring (+2 to direct influence). In order for you to control
			and keep these characters in play, you must use all of your 20 points of
			general influence (GI) and their direct influence (DI). <br>
			First, Gandalf does not require any influence-he's your Wizard. You use
			your GI to control Frodo, Aragorn II, and Gimli. This uses all 20 points:
			5 for Frodo, 9 for Aragorn II, and 6 for Gimli. Gandalf has 12 DI (his normal
			10 plus 2 for the Lesser Ring), so he uses it to control Sam, Merry, and
			Pippin (they become his followers). Aragorn II has 4 DI (his 3 plus 1 for
			Narsil), so he uses it to control Boromir II. Frodo has 6 DI (his 1 plus
			5 for The One Ring), so he uses it to control Legolas. The company size
			is 7 because Hobbits only count half. The resulting company organization
			is outlined below:<br>
			<br>
			<b>General Influence</b>(- ·20)<br>
			</font></p><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			Gimli (6·2)<br>
			Aragorn (9·3+1)<br>

			<b>Clarification</b>: If you do not have enough influence to control all

			<font size="+1">COMPANIES</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">A company is a group of characters that move and act together. This allows
			characters to move, act, and defend as a unit, allowing stronger characters
			to protect the weaker characters. This mechanism can be used to allow a
			variety of tactics during play. <br>
			For example, if you have 3 characters in play, the 3 characters can move
			separately and perhaps do more in terms of acquiring marshalling points
			(items, other characters, etc.); but each individual character is more vulnerable
			to danger. However, the same 3 characters operating as a company might acquire
			marshalling points more slowly, but they are safer (i.e., you risk less).<br>
			Normally, a company is limited to a size of seven, but a company at a Haven
			site may be of any size. For these purposes, a Wizard counts as a character,
			but an ally does not. The size of a company is determined for each company
			at the beginning of the movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed even
			if a character leaves the company). </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">BRINGING CHARACTERS INTO PLAY</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">During your organization phase, you may perform one and only one of the
			following activities: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>You may play a character card. You must have enough general influence
			or direct influence available to control the character. You must place
			him at his home site or at any Haven site. </li>
			<li>You may play a Wizard card if you do not have one in play. You must
			place a Wizard at his home site or at Rivendell. You need not control a
			Wizard with influence-he represents you, the player. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">When you play a character, you may place him into a company already at
			his arrival site or he may become a new company (consisting of one character).
			In the second case, you must place the arrival site card next to the character
			played.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: If character is played at his home site
			or a Haven site and there is no company there, you must play the site card
			for his arrival site with him. If the appropriate site card is not available,
			you may not play the character.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Playing a character does not tap a site.</i><br>Each
			character and Wizard is unique. So if you already have a character in play,
			your opponent may not play the same character. Similarly, if a character
			has been eliminated, he may not be brought into play again by either player.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: In our example from page 11, Jessica calls the Free
			Council. Then Jason gets to take his final turn. Since his company is at
			a Haven, Jason may play a character card from his hand during his organization
			phase. Jason has Éomer (with a 3 mind attribute) in his hand so he
			plays him. Jason has 3 points of unused general influence; he also has Théoden
			with 3 points of unused direct influence and Radagast with 3 points of unused
			direct influence. So Éomer may be placed under the control of general
			influence, Théoden, or Radagast (Jason's choice). <br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">REVEALING A WIZARD</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Once you decide to reveal your Wizard, you may still use your pool of
			general influence points; but, in addition, your Wizard acts as a character
			(a very powerful one). While revealing your Wizard is an advantage, it also
			carries with it the danger of losing the game by losing your Wizard to death
			or corruption. <br>
			After being revealed, a Wizard operates as a character and thus may use
			his direct influence just like any other character. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">HEALING</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Each of your characters at a Haven may heal during the untap phase of
			your turn. Such a character moves from a wounded position to a tapped position
			(i.e., the character is still tapped). In addition, certain cards can heal
			characters when they are played (e.g., Healing Herbs, Halfling Strength,
			etc.). </font></p>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">6 · Movement</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">In METW the lands of northwest Middle-earth are represented by regions.
			The site cards represent places that companies can visit within those regions.
			Except for a moving company during its movement/hazard phase, each company
			always has a current site card associated with it-the company is located
			at that site. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The specific region cards are not used
			with the Starter Rules. Remove these cards from your location deck if you
			are not using the Standard Rules. Region cards are not included in starter
			decks.<br>
			<b>Note</b>: Site paths do not direct the movement process. The site path
			is used to determine which hazard creatures your opponent may play against
			your moving company. <br>
			<b>Note</b>: By using the site cards and site cards only, a company can
			move from any site to any other site. First, if necessary, the company moves
			to the nearest Haven. Then, if necessary, it moves to another Haven. Finally,
			it moves from that Haven to the destination site. </i><br>A company commits
			to moving by playing a new site card (face down) during its organization
			phase. A company does not have to move during a given turn (i.e., it does
			not play a new site card). <br>
			At the beginning of its movement/hazard phase, a moving company current
			site card becomes its site of origin-the company is considered to be en
			route to its new site card (i.e., the company is moving). <br>
			At the end of a moving company's movement/hazard phase (before players return
			to their hand sizes), its site of origin is removed (discard if tapped;
			otherwise, return it to your location deck) and the new site card becomes
			the company's current site card. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Some cards can interrupt this process
			by forcing a company to return to its site of origin.</i><br><b>Moving From
			a Non-Haven Site</b><br>
			If the company's site of origin is a non-Haven site, the new site card must
			be the Haven listed as the nearest Haven on the site of origin card (i.e.,
			the company can move back to its nearest Haven).<br>
			<br>
			<b>Moving From a Haven Site</b><br>
			If the company's site of origin is a Haven, the new site card must meet
			one of the following requirements: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>· If the new site card is not another Haven, it must list the
			site of origin as its nearest Haven (i.e., the company can move to any
			site that has the site of origin as the company's nearest Haven). </li>
			<li>· If the new site card is another Haven, it must give a site path
			to the site of origin (i.e., the company can move to one of two adjacent
			Havens; each Haven is adjacent to two other Havens). </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: If a company is not moving, no cards
			are drawn. If a company is moving to a non-haven site, you may draw up to
			the # of cards indicated by the site that it is moving to (at least one
			card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. If a company is moving
			to a haven site, you may draw up to the # of cards indicated by the site
			that it is moving from (at least one card must be draw); your opponent does
			the same.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: To summarize the movement process:</i> </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Except for a moving company during its movement/hazard phase, each
			company is always at a specific site, called its current site. </li>
			<li>A company wanting to move to a new site plays a new site card face
			down beside its current site card by the end of its organization phase.
			A company can only move: from a non-Haven site to its "Nearest Haven,"
			from a Haven site to one of its two "adjacent Havens," or from
			a Haven site to a non-Haven site that lists that Haven as its "Nearest
			Haven." </li>
			<li>At the beginning of its movement/hazard phase, a moving company's new

			</li>
			<li>At the end of its movement/hazard phase, the site of origin is removed
			and the moving company's new site card becomes the company's current site
			card. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b><i>Suggestion</i></b><i>: To help decide where a company should move,
			look at the resource cards in your hand. Then decide to which of your available
			sites to move. For example, if you have a major item, go to a site where
			a major item can be played.</i><br><br><b>Example</b>: Jessica's company
			is in Bree (i.e., its current site) and wants to go to Thranduil's Halls
			to try and bring the Wood-elves faction into play. Bree's nearest Haven
			is Rivendell, while Thranduil's Halls nearest Haven is Lórien. <br>
			First, it takes one turn to move from Bree to Rivendell using the site path,
			w w, indicated on the Bree site card. Jessica just plays the Rivendell site
			card as her new site card during her organization phase, and she removes
			the Bree site card at the end of her movement/hazard phase. <br>
			During the next turn, the company may move from Rivendell to Lórien
			using the site path, w w b w, indicated on both the Rivendell and Lórien
			site cards. Jessica plays the Lórien site card during her organization
			phase, and she removes the Rivendell site card at the end of her movement/hazard
			phase. <br>
			Finally, the company takes one turn to move from Lórien to Thranduil's
			Halls using the site path, w b b, indicated on the Thranduil's Halls site

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">7 · Combat </font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Combat normally occurs when one of three things happen: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>When a creature hazard is played on a company. </li>
			<li>When a company at a site with an automatic-attack decides to attempt

			and explore the site). </li>
			<li>When any other card indicates that a company must face an attack. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1">ATTACKS &amp; STRIKES</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Combat consists of one or more attacks that must be resolved one at a
			time. An attack consists of one or more strikes: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Each strike can target one and only one character in the attacked company.
			</li>
			<li>Each character can be the target of only one strike from a given attack.
			</li>
			<li>If an attack has more strikes than the company has characters, the
			attacker may allocate the excess strikes as -1 modifications (i.e., a -1
			modification for each unallocated strike) to the prowess(es) of whichever
			target(s) he chooses. See the Strike Sequence on page 32. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Unless the attack states otherwise, the defender chooses which untapped
			characters will be the targets of given strikes. Then, the attacker chooses
			which other defending characters not yet assigned a strike will be the target
			of any remaining unassigned strikes. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Against a given attack, a character
			may only defend against one strike. <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: If the text on a creature card states that the "attacker
			chooses defending characters," any characters in the defending company
			may be chosen (by the attacker) as the targets of the attack's strikes.
			<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: All of an attack's strikes must be assigned to the
			characters in the defending company or as modifications to the strikes assigned.
			The attacker may not choose to not apply strikes. Any strike in excess of
			the number of characters in the company becomes a -1 modification to prowess
			of one character taking a strike (the attacker chooses). Only those strikes
			that are assigned need be defeated for the creature's marshalling points
			to be received by the defender.</i><br><b>Strike Modifications</b><br>
			There are a number of standard modifications to strikes: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Each unwounded, tapped character must modify his prowess by -1. </li>
			<li>Each wounded character must modify his prowess by -2. </li>
			<li>Normally a character that is the target of a strike is tapped after
			the strike is resolved. However, a character that is the target of a strike
			may choose to take a -3 modification to his prowess to avoid being tapped.
			If so, the character is not tapped after the strike is resolved (he may
			still be wounded). </li>
			<li>If an attack has more strikes than the company has characters, the
			attacker may allocate the excess strikes as -1 modifications to the prowesses
			of whichever target(s) he chooses. See the Strike Sequence on page 32.
			</li>
			<li>The target's prowess may also be modified due to the play of certain
			resource and hazard cards. Only one resource card requiring skill may be
			played against a given strike. </li>

			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The prowess modifications marked with

			after the attack is resolved. That is they do not carry over from attack
			to attack.</i><br>
			<br><b>Resolving Strikes</b><br>
			Strikes are resolved one at a time as decided by the defending player. When
			you choose a strike to resolve, determine all of the factors affecting the
			strike before the roll is made (see "The Strike Sequence" below).
			<br>
			To resolve a strike, the defender makes a roll (2D6) and adds his modified
			prowess: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>If this result is greater than the strike's prowess, the strike fails.
			Such a strike is defeated if its body attribute is "&amp;shyp;" or
			if it has a body attribute and fails a body check. </li>
			<li>If this result is equal to the strike's prowess, the strike was ineffectual
			(i.e., a "tie" means that the strike is avoided but not defeated).
			</li>
			<li>Otherwise, the strike was successful (i.e., the character was defeated).
			The target character is wounded and must make a body check. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b>Body Checks</b><br>
			If a strike against a character is successful, the character is wounded
			and must make a body check. To make a body check, the attacker makes a roll
			(2D6); if this value is greater than the character's body attribute, the
			character is eliminated. If the character was already wounded before this
			strike, the roll is modified by +1.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: If a character was already wounded before
			a strike wounds him again, the resulting body check modification is always
			+1 (regardless of how many times a character is wounded). <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: If a strike against a character is successful, a body
			check must be resolved for the character before anything else happens. For
			example, Healing Herbs may not be used to heal such a character until after
			the body check is resolved (of course, if the character is eliminated, the
			Healing Herbs may not be used on him at all). </i><br>As presented above,
			a strike that fails is defeated if its body attribute is "&amp;shyp;"
			or if it has a body attribute and fails a body check. To make such a body
			check, the defender makes a roll (2D6); if this value is greater than the
			strike's body attribute, the strike is defeated. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: Smaug has a prowess of 17 and a body of 8. He normally
			has two strikes when he attacks. If one of his strikes against a character
			fails, the defender makes a body check. If the resulting roll is greater
			than 8, that strike is defeated. However, both of Smaug's strikes must be
			defeated in order for him to be eliminated-this would require at least two
			body check rolls greater than 8.<br>
			<br><b>Defeating an Attack</b><br>
			An attack by a hazard creature is defeated if all of its strikes directed
			against (i.e., assigned to) a company are defeated. If a defeated attack
			is a hazard creature, the card is placed in the defender's marshalling point
			pile. The defender receives marshalling points for eliminating it.<br>
			If a hazard creature has multiple attacks, each must be defeated in order
			for the defender to receive the marshalling points.<br>
			If one of the strikes was canceled or ineffectual, the attack is not defeated.
			If the attack is canceled, the attack is not defeated. A canceled attack
			has no effect on the defending company.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: Faramir is untapped with a prowess of 5 and a body of
			8. He is facing a strike from a Huorn (only has one strike) with a prowess
			of 10 and a body of "&amp;shyp;." Faramir could decide not to tap
			against the strike; in which case his prowess would only be 2 (his normal
			prowess of 5, minus 3 for not tapping) against this strike. However, Faramir
			decides to tap to face the strike. <br>
			If Faramir rolls a 6 or better (i.e., his prowess plus the roll will be
			greater than the Huorn's prowess of 10), the strike fails and the Huorn
			attack is defeated (it only has one strike and its body attribute is "&amp;shyp;").
			<br>
			If Faramir rolls a 5 (i.e., his prowess plus the roll is equal to the Huorn's
			prowess of 10), the strike is ineffectual. <br>
			If Faramir rolls a 4 or less (i.e., his prowess plus the roll is less than
			the Huorn's prowess of 10), the strike was successful. Faramir is wounded
			and must make a body check. The attacker makes a die roll-if the result
			is 9 or more, Faramir is eliminated and removed from play.<br><b>The Strike
			Sequence</b><br>
			You and your opponent must play any cards that modify the number of strikes
			before you assign the strikes. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Note</i></b><i>: The "strike sequence" is the time from
			when a player declares that one of his characters will resolve a strike
			until the strike die roll is made and any associated body checks are made.</i><br>Strikes
			are resolved one at a time as decided by the defending player (i.e., he
			chooses a strike to resolve, the strike is resolved, he chooses the next
			strike to resolve, the strike is resolved, etc.). <br>
			All of the factors affecting the strike must be decided before making the
			roll (2D6). Address these factors in the following order: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>The attacker may play hazard cards that affect the strike (these count
			toward the hazard limit against this company). </li>
			<li>The attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining (if any)
			-1 modifications due to unallocated strikes (i.e., strikes in excess of
			the company's size). </li>
			<li>A target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will
			not automatically tap. </li>
			<li>The defending player may play resource cards that affect the strike
			(up to one card that requires skill). </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Certain attacks state that each character
			in the company "faces one strike" or "is attacked" (e.g.,
			Crebain, Watcher in the Water, etc.). Such an attack is never affected by
			a card or effect that modifies the number of strikes of an attack. <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: The prowess modification and maximum for a weapon
			is applied to a character before any other modifications. For example, Beorn
			has a base prowess of 7 and a Sword of Gondolin (+2 prowess to a maximum
			of 8)-he starts with a prowess of 8 before any other modifications are applied.
			<br>
			Similarly, the body modification and maximum for a shield or armor is applied
			before any other modifications.</i><br><b>Example of Combat</b> [(#/#) means
			(prowess/body)]<br>
			You control Bilbo (1/9), Balin (4/7) and his follower Bofur (4/7) (with
			Healing Herbs), Beretar (5/8), and Beregond (4/8) (with an Elven Cloak).
			They are en route from Rivendell to Lórien. There are 4.5 characters
			in the company which rounds up to 5, meaning the hazard limit is 5. <br>
			Your opponent plays Orc-raiders. He keys this hazard creature to the border-land
			of your company's site path because he is mindful of Beregond's Elven Cloak
			(a minor item that cancels a strike keyed to wilderness). Bilbo, a scout,
			taps and plays Concealment to cancel the attack. Orc-raiders is discarded.
			That's 1 hazard down and potentially 4 to go.<br>
			Your opponent next plays Orc-warband (second hazard) and states it is keyed
			to the border-land. It's a (4/-) hazard creature with 5 strikes that receives
			+3 to prowess against a company that has faced an Orc attack. Even though
			Bilbo canceled the Orc-raiders, the company is still considered to have
			faced them, so the Orc-warband will be (7/-). There are 5 strikes and 5
			characters, so each character will face one strike (no decisions on strike
			allocation can be made). Bilbo elects to face his strike first. His opponent
			plays Weariness of the Heart (third hazard) on Bilbo to give -1 to his prowess.
			This modification to his prowess is in addition to the -1 Bilbo suffers
			for being tapped. No other effects are played to affect the strike and Bilbo
			rolls the dice. The result is a 5. Bilbo's prowess of -1 plus the dice roll
			is less than the prowess of the Orc-warband's strike against Bilbo, so Bilbo
			is wounded. Your opponent rolls the body check. It's a 7-Bilbo lives!<br>
			Beregond faces the next strike. Beregond taps and rolls a 10, defeating
			his strike handily. Bofur chooses to face his strike next. He a special
			+1 prowess bonus versus Orcs, and he chooses not to tap (-3 to his prowess).
			He rolls a 5 which ties the prowess of the Orc-warband strike. The strike
			is ineffectual. <br>
			Facing the next strike, Balin taps, and rolls a 7 to defeat it. Beretar
			resolves the final strike, taps, and defeats it by rolling a 3. Orc-warband
			is discarded. <br>
			Your opponent sees that one character, Bofur, is untapped. He plays Giant
			(13/-) (a fourth hazard) and reasons that Bofur will have to take its one
			vicious strike. (After all, if you give up the option of assigning the one
			strike to your untapped character, namely Bofur, the opponent will be able
			to choose from all 5 characters which will take the strike). Your opponent
			does not see what Bofur sees. Before assigning the strike, Bofur taps and
			uses his Healing Herbs to untap Beregond, who then announces he is taking
			the strike. The Giant is keyed solely to double wilderness, so Beregond
			taps his Elven Cloak to cancel its single strike. The Giant is discarded.
			<br>
			The opponent announces he will play no more hazards and the company breathes
			a sigh of relief. Bilbo will be able to heal at the start of the next turn
			since his company will be in Lórien, a Haven.<br> <br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="Corruption"></a></font>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">8 · Corruption </font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">As characters adventure in Middle-earth, they are subject to temptations.
			They run the risk of becoming corrupted and leaving the cause of the Free
			Peoples (i.e., a corrupted character leaves play, a corrupted Wizard loses
			the game). In The Lord of the Rings, Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast
			was corrupted by the lure of nature, Alatar and Pallando succumbed to unknown
			corruption and disappeared into the East. <br>
			Each character has a corruption point total. This starts at zero, but certain
			cards and activities will increase and decrease this total during play.
			Most cards that affect a character's corruption are kept under the character's
			card until they are discarded. Only one corruption card (a hazard card that
			gives corruption points) may be played on a given character each turn. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: For these purposes, a "corruption
			card" is a hazard card that gives a character corruption points. Cards
			that force a corruption check but do not give corruption points (e.g., Weariness
			of the Heart, Ren the Unclean, etc.) are not "corruption cards."<br>
			A character may have more than one corruption card, but only one may be
			played on him each turn. <br>
			Certain corruption cards state: "Cannot be duplicated on a given character."
			So, a given character may only have one of each such corruption card.</i><br><b>CORRUPTION
			POINTS</b><br>
			A character's corruption point total can be determined at any time by summing
			the corruption point values of: the corruption cards under his card and
			any other cards he controls (e.g., usually items). <br>
			<br>
			<b>CORRUPTION CHECKS</b><br>
			When a card or other effect indicates that one of your characters must make
			a corruption check, you must make a roll (2D6) and add any appropriate modifications.
			One of the following results: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li><b>Nothing Happens</b> - If the modified result is greater than the
			character's corruption point total, nothing happens. </li>
			<li><b>The Character is Discarded</b> - If the modified result is equal
			to the character's corruption point total or one less than the character's
			corruption point total, the character fails the corruption check and you
			must discard the character along with any non-follower cards he controls.
			In this case, if the character is a Wizard, you immediately lose the game.
			</li>
			<li><b>The Character is Eliminated</b> - If the modified result is less
			than character's corruption point total by two or more, the character fails
			the corruption check and is eliminated (i.e., remove him from play) and
			you must discard any non-follower cards he controls. In this case, if the
			character is a Wizard, you immediately lose the game. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: A character discarded due to a corruption
			check is not removed from play. He may be played again either by you (e.g.,
			if you exhaust your play deck and draw that character) or by your opponent
			(e.g., if he has that character in his hand). In this case, the character
			stops working for the cause of the Free Peoples (at least for a while)-much
			as Radagast was corrupted by the physical nature of Middle-earth (i.e.,
			he went "native").<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: A character eliminated due to a corruption check is
			removed from play. He may not be played again by either you or by your opponent.
			In this case, the character is permanently lost to the Free Peoples-much
			as Saruman was corrupted in The Lord of the Rings.</i><br><b>CORRUPTION
			CHECK MODIFIERS</b><br>
			Certain characters receive modifications to corruption checks, and certain
			cards may give modifications to a corruption check. Modifications to corruption
			checks are printed in the lower right of the appropriate card. A plus or
			a minus sign indicates a modification to any corruption checks rather than
			corruption points.<br>
			<br>
			<br><i>Clarification: There are two different values that affect corruption
			checks: </i></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Corruption check modifications always have either a plus (+) sign or
			a minus (&amp;shyp;) sign (e.g., as noted on many character cards). The sum
			of all such applicable modifications are added to the corruption check
			roll. </li>
			<li>Corruption point values never have a plus or minus sign. The sum of
			all such values is the character's corruption point total for the purposes
			of a corruption check. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Both values appear in the lower right of certain cards. <br><br><b>Example</b>:
			(CP = Corruption Points) Using the Middle-earth: The Wizards terms, lets
			take a look at Frodo at several points during the action in The Lord of
			the Rings between the Shire and Lórien. Frodo has a special ability:
			he has a corruption check modifier of +4 (as provided in the bottom right
			corner of his card). <br>
			When Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin flee the Shire, Frodo only has one item:
			The One Ring (it gives Frodo 6 corruption points). Suppose Frodo has to
			make a corruption check (roll 2D6) in this situation: if a 2 is rolled,
			the modified roll is 6 (2 + 4 for his special ability) and Frodo is discarded.
			Any other roll would have no effect on Frodo.<br>
			When Tom Bombadil rescues Frodo and company in the Barrow Downs, Frodo receives
			a Dagger of Westernesse (1 CP). So Frodo's CP total becomes 7. He would
			be discarded if he makes a corruption check roll of 2 or 3 (if there are
			no other modifications).<br>
			On the way to Rivendell, Frodo is wounded by a Morgul-knife (4 CPs)-his
			CP total is now 11. If forced to make a corruption check, he is discarded
			on a roll of 6 or 7 and he is eliminated on a roll of 5 or less.<br>
			Finally, he reaches Rivendell and the Morgul-knife card is removed, dropping
			his CP total back to 7. However, he is then affected by Lure of the Senses
			(a hazard card giving 2 CPs and requiring a corruption check each untap
			phase at a Haven). So during his next untap phase, he must make a corruption
			check with a CP total of 9-he is discarded on a roll of 4 or 5 and is eliminated
			on a roll of 2 or 3. <br>
			Next, Frodo gets rid of the Lure of the Senses (by rolling greater than
			6) and he transfers his Dagger of Westernesse. In addition, Bilbo gives
			him: Sting (1 CP) and The Mithril-coat (2 CPs). So Frodo's CP total is 9
			(6+1+2). If forced to make a corruption check, he is discarded on a roll
			of 4 or 5 and is eliminated on a roll of 2 or 3. <br>
			Fortunately, the Fellowship of the Ring is formed (see the company in the
			example on page 21)-we will assume that two Fellowship cards (+1 to prowess
			and corruption checks for all characters in the company) are played initially.<br>
			So Frodo leaves Rivendell with a CP total of 9 and corruption check modifiers
			totaling +6 (+4 normal +2 for Fellowship). Thus, if forced to make a corruption
			check (without other modifications), he will be discarded on a roll of 2
			or 3.<br> <br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="Influence"></a></font>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">9 · Influence </font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You have a pool of general influence. Your characters and Wizard have
			direct influence. These two forms of influence can control and affect characters
			(see pages 18-20) and factions. <br>
			Your unused general influence is equal to 20 minus the sum of the mind attributes
			of your non-follower characters in play (i.e., do not count your followers).
			<br>
			A character's unused direct influence is equal to his direct influence attribute
			minus the sum of the mind attributes of his followers. All characters have
			a direct influence attribute of at least zero, so any character has unused
			direct influence of at least zero. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Note</i></b><i>: In the Standard Game, direct influence can be
			used to attempt to interfere with your opponent's control of his characters,
			followers, factions, allies, and items (see pages 58-60).</i><br><b>BRINGING
			AN ALLY INTO PLAY</b><br>
			You can automatically bring an ally into play by tapping one of your characters.
			The character must be at the site indicated on the ally's card. Every ally
			is controlled by the character that tapped to bring it into play; i.e.,
			it must be placed under and remain with that character's card. An ally does
			not count against its controlling character's direct influence or your general
			influence.<br>
			<br>
			<b>BRINGING A FACTION INTO PLAY</b><br>
			In order to play a faction card, you must tap one of your characters that
			is at the "site" indicated on the faction's card. Then you must
			make an influence check. Make a roll (2D6), add your character's unused
			direct influence, and add any appropriate modifications (any applicable
			standard modifications from the faction card and from any other cards played).
			All modification cards must be played before making the roll (2D6). <br>
			If the modified result is greater than the value required on the faction
			card, you place the faction in your play area (it now counts towards your
			marshalling point total). Otherwise, you discard the faction card. Once
			a faction is brought into play, it is not controlled by any specific character
			and it does not count against general or direct influence.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Most faction cards list some "standard
			modifications" to the influence check based only upon the race of the
			character that was tapped to make the influence check. Similarly, certain
			characters have special modifications to influence checks. Such a modification
			only applies if it belongs to the character that was tapped to make the
			influence check.</i><br><br><b>Example</b>: Suppose, during your site phase,
			you have the Knights of Dol Amroth in your hand and a company at Dol Amroth-the
			company contains Imrahil. He has no followers, so his unused direct influence
			is 2. You tap Imrahil to attempt to bring the Knights into play. <br>
			You make your influence check roll (2D6), and the result is 5. This roll
			is modified by: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Imrahil's unused direct influence: +2. </li>
			<li>+2 - Imrahil has a special ability: his direct influence is increased
			by +2 against the Knights of Dol Amroth. </li>
			<li>A standard modification of +1, because Imrahil is a Dúnadan
			and a standard modification of +1 is listed on the Knights of Dol Amroth
			card. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">So the modified result is 10 (=5+2+2+1). Since this is greater than 8
			(the number required by the faction card), the Knights of Dol Amroth are
			successfully brought into play.<br>
			If you had rolled a 3, your modified result would have been 8 (=3+2+2+1),
			and you would have had to discard the faction card.<br> <br>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">10 · Playing and Drawing Cards</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You may only play hazard cards during your opponent's movement/hazard
			phase. Except for resource long-events, you may play resource cards anytime
			during your own turn unless specifically prohibited by the rules or the
			cards themselves.<br>
			Unless stated otherwise, a card is playable only if its effect applies to
			an existing situation, hazard, attack, etc. (i.e., you may not play a card
			just to discard it). <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: An automatic-attack at a company's new
			site may be targeted by a hazard during the company's movement/hazard phase
			(e.g., Arouse Minions, Dragon's Desolation, etc.). Playing such a hazard
			does count against the hazard limit. Such a hazard may be played even if
			the attack ultimately will not be faced (i.e., if the company decides not
			to face the automatic-attack during the site phase).</i><br>During your
			movement/hazard phase, both players draw cards when each company moves.
			If a company moves to a non-Haven site, you may draw up to the number of
			cards indicated by the site that it moved to (at least one card must be
			drawn); your opponent does the same. If the company moves to a Haven site,
			you may draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that you moved
			from (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. <br>
			<br>
			<b>THE HAZARD LIMIT</b><br>
			During your opponent's movement/hazard phase, the number of hazard cards
			that you may play on one of your opponent's companies is that company's
			hazard limit. The hazard limit is equal to two or the company's size, whichever
			is greater. A company's size is equal to the number of characters in it,
			with each Hobbit counting half (round up). For this purpose, Wizards and
			followers do count as characters, but allies do not. <br>
			A hazard limit can be modified by the play of certain cards. Tapping a Nazgûl
			permanent-event does count against the hazard limit.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: For the purposes of calculating hazard
			limits, each company's size is determined for each company at the beginning
			of the movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed). So, if a character
			is eliminated during his company's portion of the movement/hazard phase,
			his company's hazard limit does not change.</i><br><b>HAZARD CARDS</b><br>
			Hazard cards represent evil forces and natural dangers in Middle-earth.
			You may play hazard cards only during your opponent's movement/hazard phase.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Creature Cards</b> <br>
			You may use a creature card to directly attack one of your opponent's companies.
			Such an attack can occur only if: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>The company is at a specific site at which the creature's card text
			says it can be played. </li>
			<li>The company's site of origin or new site is in a region where the creature's
			card text says it can be played. </li>
			<li>One of the site symbols on the creature's card matches the site that
			the company moved to (i.e., the new site) or stayed at (i.e., if the company
			did not move). </li>
			<li>At least one of the region symbols on the creature's card matches one
			of the region types the company moved through this turn (see below). If
			the creature's card has two region symbols of the same type (i.e., a deep
			wilderness creature), then the company must have moved through at least
			two regions of that same type. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Two wilderness symbols are required
			in a site path to play a deep wilderness creature. However, the two symbols
			need not be adjacent in the site path. For example, a deep wilderness creature
			may be played keyed to the site path: w b b w. If a company travels with
			two wilderness on its site path, the chance of encountering very dangerous
			wilderness monsters has doubled, even if the two wildernesses are not adjacent.</i><br>If
			a creature satisfies more than one of these conditions, you must choose
			(when you play the creature) one of these conditions that the attack is
			"keyed to." The effects of certain cards are based upon the region
			or site type that a creature is keyed to.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The player that plays a hazard creature
			must specifically state the type of region or site that a creature is keyed
			to-it can affect the use of other cards. For example, if a character with
			an Elven Cloak faces a strike from a creature that has been played keyed
			to wilderness, he can tap the cloak to cancel the strike. However, if such
			a strike is keyed to border-lands, he cannot use his cloak against it.</i><br>The
			region types that a company moves through during a given turn are determined
			by the following criteria: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>If a company did not play a new site card, it did not move through
			any regions-so, no creature may be played based solely on region conditions.
			</li>
			<li>If the company was at a Haven and has played a new non-Haven site card
			(but no region cards), the region types are indicated by the new site card's
			site path. </li>
			<li>If the company was at a Haven site and has played a new Haven site
			card (but no region cards), the region types are indicated by the new Haven
			site card's "Site Path from" the old Haven site (i.e., the site
			path from the old Haven). </li>
			<li>If the company was at a non-Haven site and has played a new Haven site
			card (but no region cards), the region types are indicated by the site
			of origin's site path (i.e., the site path on the site that the company
			left). </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b>Standard Game Only</b>: If the company played region cards, the
			region types of the site path are indicated by the region cards (i.e., each
			region card has a region type).<br>
			<b>Example</b>: Certain card combinations make a specific card more powerful
			and allow it to be played more often. Ren the Unclean (a Nazgûl) has
			one strike with a prowess of 15 and can only be played keyed to dark-domains
			and dark-holds. However, if played in combination with a Fell Beast card,
			Ren has two strikes with a prowess of 13 and can be played keyed to shadow-lands,
			shadow-holds, dark-domains, and dark-holds.<br>
			If Ren is played in combination with a Fell Beast card and a Morgul-knife
			card, he has two strikes with a prowess of 15 and can be played keyed to
			shadow-lands, shadow-holds, dark-domains, and dark-holds. In addition, one
			character wounded by his attack receives 4 corruption points due to the
			Morgul-knife.<br><b>RESOURCE CARDS</b><br>
			Certain resource cards may only be played if specific required conditions
			exist.<br>
			<br>
			<i><br><b>Clarification</b>: Playing a faction card, ally card, information
			card, or item card (unless stated otherwise on the card) requires an untapped
			character and an untapped site. In addition, the company must face any automatic-attacks
			located at the same site before such a card can be played. Playing another
			type of resource card does not neccessarily require an untapped site. This
			process may vary based upon specific card text.</i><br>
			<br><b>Factions</b> - If one of your characters is at the site specified
			on a faction card, he may tap to attempt to play the faction card. If the
			character successfully influences the faction as indicated on the faction's
			card (see p. 39), the faction card is placed in your play area. After a
			faction is successfully played at a site, the site card is tapped.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Once a faction is brought into play,
			it is not associated with any character. A faction plays no active role
			after it is brought into play. </i><br><b>Items</b> - If a character is
			at an untapped site that indicates that a specific type of item card (gold
			ring, minor, major, or greater) is "playable," he may tap to bring
			an item of that type into play. The item card is placed under the character's
			card. After an item is played at a site, the site card is tapped.<br>
			A character may only use the effects of one weapon at a time and one shield
			at a time and one armor at a time.<br>
			If a character is eliminated by corruption, discard all of the items that
			he controls. If a character is eliminated due to failing a body check, one
			item can be immediately transferred to each unwounded character in his company;
			but, the rest of his items are discarded.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: An item only taps when used if its text
			states so. Thus, weapons and armor do not normally tap when used. <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: A character may control (i.e., bear) any item, even
			if he cannot use its abilities.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: A character may control (i.e., bear) more than one
			weapon or more than one shield or more than one armor. However, only one
			of each type may be used at any given time.</i><br>
			<br><b>Minor Items</b> - If a resource card that taps a site (e.g., ally,
			faction, item, information, etc.) is successfully played at a site, one
			additional character may tap to play a minor item. Such a minor item may
			be played even if the site does not specifically state that a minor item
			is playable at the site. For example, a minor item played when bringing
			an ally into play would simulate a gift from the ally.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: Certain card combinations are required to bring certain
			powerful items into play. Narsil was a mighty sword that was broken when
			Elendil fell fighting Sauron. Narsil can be played and used as a greater
			item (+1 direct influence, +1 prowess, 3 MPs, 2 CPs). However, a player
			can attempt to reforge Narsil so that it becomes Andúril, the Flame
			of the West (Aragorn II's weapon in The Lord of the Rings).<br>
			Two other cards are required. A Reforging card must be played at an "information
			site" and stored at a Haven-this represents gathering the resources
			required to reforge Narsil. Then, the Andúril card must be played
			at an "information site" and stored at a Haven-this represents
			gaining the knowledge of how to reforge Narsil. <br>
			Then, the Reforging card is discarded and the Andúril card is placed
			with the Narsil card-giving a total of (+2 direct influence, +5 prowess,
			7 MPs, 3 CPs) from the combination of the two cards. <br><b>Allies</b> -
			A character may tap to play an ally card if he is at the site specified
			on the ally card and the character meets the requirements indicated on the
			ally card. The ally card is placed under the character's card and that character
			controls the ally. After an ally is played at a site, the site card is tapped.
			An ally does not count as a character for any purposes other than combat
			and the use of certain skills. Allies can not bear items.<br>
			An ally with a skill may take actions and play cards that require that skill.
			For example, Treebeard has the sage skill, so he can tap to play a Dreams
			of Lore card. Similarly, Gollum has the scout skill so he can tap to play
			a Concealment card.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Allies that are eliminated are placed
			in the out-of-play pile (i.e., neither player may bring that ally back into
			play). Allies are not affected by corruption.</i><br><b>EVENTS</b><br>
			There are both resource events and hazard events. Each event falls into
			one of three classifications based upon how long it stays in play. <br>
			<b>Short-event</b> - A short-event's effects are immediately implemented.
			Then the event card is discarded. The effects of some short-events last
			for a specific period as stated on its card (e.g., many short-event effects
			last "until the end of the turn").<br>
			<b>Permanent-event</b> - The effects of a resource permanent-event are immediately
			implemented. Its effects last until the card is discarded. Certain effects
			can cause a permanent-event to be discarded; these effects are given in
			the text of specific cards. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Hazard short-events and permanent-events
			can be played only during an opponent's movement/hazard phase. Resource
			short-events and permanent-events can be played at any time during your
			turn-as limited by specific card text.</i><br><b>Long-event</b> - The effects
			of a long-event are immediately implemented when it is played. Long-events
			last approximately two turns, one of yours and one of your opponent's. <br>
			You may only play a resource long-event during your long-event phase. Its
			card and effects remain in play until your next long-event phase or until
			otherwise discarded. <br>
			You may only play a hazard long-event during your opponent's movement/hazard
			phase. Its card and effects remain in play until your opponent's next long-event
			phase or until otherwise discarded.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: The effects of many long-events and
			permanent-events affect both players because they can remain in effect during
			both players' turns. So remember, when you play a long-event hazard on your
			opponent during his turn, it will remain in effect during your next turn.
			For example, Awaken Denizens (a long-event) increases the number of automatic-attack
			strikes at Ruins &amp; Lairs for one turn for each player.</i><br><br><b>Example</b>:
			One of Jason's companies with a hazard limit of six is moving from Rivendell
			to Lórien; its site path is w w b w. Jessica plays Doors of Night
			(a permanent-event) during Jason's movement/hazard phase. This causes all
			resource environment cards in play to be discarded and their effects are
			canceled. This card will remain in play until it is discarded due to the
			play of a Gates of Morning, Twilight, or another card that targets the Doors
			of Night.<br>
			Jessica then plays Choking Shadows (a short-event). She decides to use its
			option of treating one wilderness [w] as a shadow-land [s] until the end
			of the turn. This changes the site path for Jason's company from w w b w
			to: w s b w. Choking Shadows is discarded, but its effects will remain until
			the end of the turn (unless canceled before that).<br>
			Then, Jessica next plays Morgul Night (a long-event)-all wildernesses [w]
			to be treated as shadow-lands [s] and all shadow-lands [s] to be treated
			as dark-domains [d]. This changes the site path for Jason's company from
			w s b w to: s d b s. Jessica can still play three more hazards and she can
			key them to border-lands, shadow-lands, and/or dark-domains. Unless its
			discard is forced by another card, Morgul Night and its effects will remain
			in play until Jessica's next long-event phase (approximately two turns).<br><b>STORING
			CARDS</b><br>
			During your organization phase, you may store any of your items that are
			at a Haven site. The controlling character must make a corruption check
			before an item can be stored.<br>
			A stored item is placed in your marshalling point pile and still counts
			for marshalling points. Once an item is stored it may not be unstored and
			brought back into play. The One Ring may not be stored. <br>
			Some items and resource cards state that they can be stored when at a specific
			site (e.g., the Book of Mazarbul can be stored at a Dwarf-hold). Such an
			item or resource card is still placed in the marshalling point pile and
			cannot be brought back into play.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Certain cards state that a character
			bearing such a card cannot untap until the card is stored at a certain place.
			After storing such a card, the character does not untap until the untap
			phase of his player's next turn. <br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Unless stated otherwise on the card, the marshalling
			points for a card that can be stored apply regardless of whether or not
			the card is stored.</i><br><b>TRANSFERRING ITEMS</b><br>
			During your organization phase, you may transfer items between characters
			at the same site. The controlling character must make a corruption check
			before an item can be transferred.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: A corruption check is required before
			an item can be stored or transferred. A character that fails such a corruption
			check has decided not to follow his Wizard's advice and influence concerning
			the item's use (i.e., the item is discarded and the character is either
			discarded or eliminated). </i><br>ACTIONS AND CARD PLAY<br>
			The various activities that you and your opponent can perform during play
			are called actions. Typical actions include playing a card, tapping a card,
			revealing a card, etc. The following general guidelines apply to resolving
			actions; more detailed guidelines can be found on pages 61-63. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>You must give your opponent a chance to respond to every action, and
			vice versa. If you perform an action and move on to another action without
			giving your opponent a chance to respond, you must "back up"
			if he indicates that he wants to respond. A series of declared actions
			made in response to one another is called a chain of effects. You always
			have the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during
			your turn. The actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time
			from last declared to first declared (i.e., the last declared action is
			resolved first, then the second to the last, etc.). </li>
			<li>If the play of a card requires other actions (e.g., corruption checks),
			the actions are resolved in the order in which they appear on the card.
			</li>
			<li>A required or declared dice roll is an action and can be the target
			of another action or effect declared later in the same chain of effects.
			</li>
			<li>When the effects of a dice roll require further actions (e.g., a roll
			for a strike requires a body check), those actions become the first actions
			(any further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects after the roll.
			</li>

			Standard Rules </font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You should read and master the Starter Rules before tackling the Standard
			Rules. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="TheVictoryConditions2"></a>1 · The Victory Conditions</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">The Standard Rules victory conditions differ from those found in the
			Starter Rules in two ways. First, the players can decide to play a longer
			game, and/or second, certain modifications to the marshalling point totals
			can be made at the Free Council. <br>
			<br>
			<b>THE LONGER GAMES</b><br>
			The Starter Game is also called the "1-deck game." For experienced
			players with tuned decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you
			want longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.<br>
			<b>The 2-deck Game</b><br>
			In a "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is
			called when each play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council
			when your play deck has been exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted
			once and you have at least 25 marshalling points (MPs).<br>
			<b>The 3-deck Game</b><br>
			In a "3-deck game" (the "long game"), the Council is
			called when each play deck has been exhausted three times. You may call
			the Council when your play deck has been exhausted three times, or when
			it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshalling points.
			Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.<br>
			<b>The 4-deck Game</b><br>
			In a "4-deck game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the
			Council is called when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You
			may call the Council when your play deck has been exhausted four times,
			or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshalling
			points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.<br>
			<br>
			<b>MARSHALLING POINT MODIFICATIONS</b><br>
			At the Free Council, you may reveal any unique marshalling point cards in
			your hand that match unique cards that your opponent has in play. Each such
			revealed card reduces your opponent's marshalling point total by one.<br>
			There are six different types of marshalling points; each is associated
			with a specific shape: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Character Points - Octagon </li>
			<li>Item Points (Major, Greater, &amp; Rings only) - Square </li>
			<li>Faction Points - Triangle pointing down </li>
			<li>Ally Points - Triangle pointing up </li>
			<li>Kill Points (from defeating creatures) - Circle </li>
			<li>Miscellaneous Points - Diamond </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">These types of marshalling points can affect your marshalling point total
			in two ways: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>If your opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of
			marshalling point, your points for that same type of marshalling point
			are doubled. This doesn't apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.
			</li>
			<li>No more than half (round up) of your final marshalling points can come
			from any one type of marshalling point. If one type of marshalling point
			is over half of your total, reduce the points for that type until they
			are only half (or less) of your total. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: These marshalling point modifications
			do not apply until the Free Council actually takes place. Specifically,
			the modifications do not affect your marshalling point total when it is
			used to determine if you can call the Free Council (i.e., you need 20 MPs
			to call the Free Council before any of these modifications are made).</i><br><br><b>Example</b>:
			Let's look again at our example from page 11. Assume Jason failed to play
			the Men of Northern Rhovanion (3 MPs) on his last turn. Assume none of the
			characters failed a corruption check (i.e., they all come to the Free Council).
			<br>
			Jessica notices that Jason has no faction points (he blew his roll to get
			the Men of Northern Rhovanion). So her faction points are doubled to 4.
			<br>
			Unfortunately, Jason's problems are not over. He failed to get the 3 MPs
			from the Men of Northern Rhovanion; so his MP total is only 14-8 of them
			are character points and only 6 are non-character points. Since you cannot
			have more than half of your points from any one source, Jason only gets
			6 MPs from his characters. <br>
			At this point, the marshalling points (MPs) break down as follows:<br>
			<br>
			<b>Jessica's MP Cards MPs - Modified MPs</b><br>
			Celeborn 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Elladan 1<b> - </b>1<br>
			Elrohir 1<b> - </b>1<br>
			Gildor Inglorion 1<b> - </b>1<br>
			Legolas 2<b> - </b>2<br>
			Sword of Gondolin (item) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Men of Lebennin (faction) 2<b> - </b>4<br>
			Gwaihir (ally) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Dreams of Lore (misc) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			<b>Total 15 - 17<br>
			<br>
			Jason's MP Cards MPs - Modified MPs</b><br>
			Beorn 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Faramir 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Imrahil 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Théoden 2 <b>- </b>0<br>
			Sword of Gondolin (item) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Great Shield of Rohan (item) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			Quickbeam (ally) 2 <b>- </b>2<br>
			<b>Total 14 - 12<br>
			</b><br>
			At this point, Jason reveals that he has cards for Gwaihir, Legolas, and
			Elrohir in his hand (he was saving them for this). Since they duplicate
			three of Jessica's unique MP cards, her MP total is reduced by one for each
			of these cards. Thus, Jessica ends up with 14 MPs and Jason ends up with
			12 MPs-Jessica wins. Jason curses his luck because he failed to bring the
			Men of Northern Rhovanion into play on his last turn. <br><br>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">2 · The Cards and Decks</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">In addition to the normal location deck and play deck, you can have a
			15 card "sideboard" deck. A sideboard can contain resource, hazard,
			and character cards. However, the combined play deck and sideboard can only
			contain one of each unique card and a maximum of three of any non-unique
			card.<br>
			<b>Using Your Sideboard When You Exhaust Your Deck</b><br>
			Whenever you exhaust your play deck, you may exchange (before reshuffling)
			up to 5 cards between your sideboard and discard pile. Each such card taken
			from your sideboard must be replaced by a card from your discard pile.<br>
			<b>Using Your Sideboard When You Tap Your Wizard</b><br>
			During your organization phase, you may tap your Wizard to bring up to 5
			resource and/or character cards from your sideboard into your discard pile.
			<br>
			Alternatively, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may tap your
			Wizard to bring one resource card directly from your sideboard into your
			play deck (reshuffle).<br>
			<b>Using Your Sideboard When You Tap a Nazgûl</b><br>
			During your opponent's movement/hazard phase, you may tap one of your Nazgûl
			permanent-events in play to bring up to 5 hazard cards from your sideboard
			into your discard pile. The normal result of tapping a Nazgûl does
			not apply. The Nazgûl is discarded. Tapping a Nazgûl in this
			fashion does count against the hazard limit.<br>
			Alternatively, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may tap a Nazgûl
			permanent-event to bring one hazard card directly from your sideboard into
			your play deck (reshuffle).<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Your opponent may verify how many cards
			move to and from your sideboard, but you do not have to reveal what those
			cards are.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Your combined play deck and sideboard cannot violate
			the 1 unique card and 3 non-unique card limit. However, there is no restriction
			on the mix of hazards, resources, and characters in your sideboard. That
			is, for the purposes of your sideboard, you can ignore the play deck restrictions:
			the limit of 10 characters and the 50/50 resource/hazard mix.</i><br>

<font face="Garamond">        </font><ol>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>If the company has a face down site card (i.e., its new site card),
			turn it over. Your company's current site becomes its site of origin. </li>
			<li>If the company is not moving, no cards are drawn. If the company is
			moving to a non-haven site, you may draw up to the number of cards indicated
			by the site that it is moving to (at least one card must be drawn); your
			opponent does the same. If the company is moving to a haven site, you may
			draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that it is moving
			from (at least one card must be draw); your opponent does the same. </li>
			<li>Your opponent plays hazards on the company-each hazard is resolved
			as indicated in its text. These hazards are played and resolved one at
			a time and in some cases may not directly affect the company. A hazard
			may not be played if it targets a different company or a character in a
			different company.<br>
			If the company is not moving, hazard creatures may only be keyed to the
			company's site of origin. Hazard creatures must be "keyed to"
			the moving company's site path and/or new site. If a creature is keyed
			to more than one region type and/or site type that applies, your opponent
			decides which one is used.<br>
              The maximum number of hazards that may be played on a company during a
			given movement/hazard phase (i.e., the hazard limit) is equal to the size
			of the company or two, whichever is larger (Hobbits count half, round up).
			The hazard limit is determined for each company at the beginning of the
			movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed). </li>
			<li>If the company has been required to return to its site of origin, return
			the new site card to the location deck (or discard if it is tapped) and
			proceed to step 6 (the site of origin becomes its current site). No additional
			hazards may be played on that company. </li>
			<li>Remove the company's site of origin (i.e., the site the company came

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">There are several Standard Rules changes involving characters and companies.<br>
			<b>Splitting a Company at a Non-Haven Site</b><br>
			During the organization phase, a company at a non-haven site may split into
			two or more companies. The following instructions apply: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>· One of the companies may remain at the current site. </li>

			<li>· Any other companies must move to different sites using region
			movement. </li>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: These restrictions mean that two
			companies may not start at the same site and then move to the same site
			separately (i.e., in such a situation the two companies would have to move
			as one company). </i><br><b>Joining Two Companies at a Non-Haven Site</b><br>
			During the organization phase, two companies may move to the same site,
			but one of the following cases must apply: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>One and only one company may already be at the site. In this case the
			other company must state that its new site card is already in play (the
			current site card for the non-moving company). </li>
			<li>One company moves to the site using the site path on that site card
			(i.e., the company starts at the site's nearest Haven), and the other company
			moves to the site using region cards for its site path. In this case, both
			companies must state that the same face down site card is their new site
			card. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">In both cases, the two companies must face hazards separately and are
			then combined at the end of the movement/hazard phase.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Discarding Characters</b><br>
			Instead of bringing a new character/Wizard into play during your organization
			phase, you may discard a character that is at a Haven or at his home site.
			A Wizard may not be discarded. <br>
			You must take this action when you are forced to discard a character due
			to a lack of available influence. In this case, the character(s) need not
			be at a Haven.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Bringing Characters into Play</b><br>
			Before you play your Wizard, you may use general influence to bring a character
			into play at any haven or at his home site. After revealing your Wizard,
			you may use general influence to bring a character into play only if your
			Wizard is at the site at which the character arrives (i.e., a Haven or the
			character's home site). <br>

<font face="Garamond">			<font size="+1"><a name="Movement2"></a></font>

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">6 · Movement</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">There are two ways to move from one site to another. A company can use
			the site path on a site card (see the Starter Rules) or it can use region
			cards as its site path to a specific site card (i.e., region movement).
			<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Region movement is not necessary to
			play this game. Region movement just gives you more options; i.e., with
			region movement a company need not move to a Haven every other turn. Region
			cards are not included in starter decks.</i><br><b>REGION MOVEMENT</b><br>
			To use region movement, play a new site card (face down) and a series of
			up to four regions (face down) that connect the company's current site with
			the new site (i.e., the company moves). A series of regions "connects"
			two sites if: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>The current (i.e., site of origin) site is located in the first region,
			and </li>
			<li>That region card is adjacent to the next region card played, and </li>
			<li>That region card is adjacent to the next region card played, , and
			</li>
			<li>Finally, the last region card played is the region that the new site
			card is located in. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">A region is adjacent to another region if and only if each region lists
			the other region on its card. <br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: To use region movement for a company,
			the region cards played must include the region containing the company's
			current site and the region containing the new site. If both the current
			site and the new site are in the same region, only that region card need
			be played.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: If two sites are separated by more than four regions,
			a company may not travel directly between them in one turn (unless some
			special resource card is used, e.g., Bridge, Shadowfax, etc.). The company
			must first travel to interim sites (one per turn) until it reaches a site
			that is within four regions of the destination site.<br>
			<b>Clarification</b>: Certain regions may appear to be adjacent on the maps,
			but turn out not to be adjacent upon examination of the lists on their cards.
			For example, Dagorlad and Rohan appear to be adjacent on the maps, but they
			are really separated by the Anduin River.</i><br><b>Playing Hazards</b><br>
			For the purposes of playing hazards, the site path for a company using region
			movement is defined by the region types of the region cards played. You
			can use a creature hazard to directly attack one of your opponent's companies
			if at least one of the region types on the creature's card matches that
			region type of a region card played by the company (two are required for
			creatures that require two symbols of the same type) .<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: Region movement can be more dangerous
			to use than normal movement-certain creatures can be played keyed to specific
			region cards. <br>
			For example, suppose you decide to move a company from Lórien to
			the Easterling Camp using the region cards: Wold &amp; Foothills (w), Brown
			Lands (s), Dagorlad (s), and Horse Plains (s). The region types traveled
			through are the same as the site path used in normal movement between Lórien
			and the Easterling Camp (as given on the Easterling Camp site card)-so the
			same creatures may be played against the company based on region type. Adûnaphel
			(a Nazgûl) card normally can only be played keyed to dark-holds and
			dark-domains, but it also states that it can be played keyed to Dagorlad
			(and the Brown Lands). Thus, Adûnaphel could be played on this company
			as it moves through Dagorlad. Similarly, Indûr Dawndeath and Khamûl
			the Easterling could also be played.</i><br><br><b>Example</b>: Lets look
			at our example for movement from the Starter Game (see page 26). Jessica's
			company in Bree (in the Arthedain region) wants to move to Thranduil's Halls
			(in the Woodland Realm region) in order to bring the Wood-elves faction
			into play. If she does not use region movement, this takes three turns:
			Bree to Rivendell, Rivendell to Lórien, and Lórien to Thranduil's
			Halls. Using region movement, she can do it in 2 turns.<br>
			The shortest number of region cards required for this move is 5 and there
			are two possible routes: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>· Arthedain w, Rhudaur w, High Pass w, Anduin Vales b, Woodland

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">9 · Influence</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Influence is the only way that your characters can directly affect your
			opponent's resources. During your site phase, one and only one of your characters
			may tap to attempt to influence away one of your opponent's characters,
			followers, allies, factions, or items. This may only take place if the influencing
			character and the target of the influence are at the same site. If you successfully
			influence the target, it is discarded. In some cases, you may reveal an
			identical card and attempt to play it (i.e., he convinces the target to
			join his side). <br>
			Such an influence attempt may not be made on the first turn, and a Wizard
			may not make such an attempt on the turn he is revealed. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Influencing an Opponent's Character</b><br>
			To attempt to influence one of your opponent's non-Wizard characters you
			must make an influence check. You make a roll (2D6) and: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Add the influencing character's unused direct influence. </li>
			<li>Subtract your opponent's unused general influence points. </li>
			<li>Subtract the result of a roll (2D6) made by your opponent . </li>
			<li>Add any other modifications (from cards and special abilities). All
			modification cards must be played before making the roll. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">If the modified result is greater than the target's mind attribute, the
			target character card and all of the non-follower cards he controls are
			discarded. Otherwise, nothing happens.<br>
			If you reveal an identical character card from your hand before making the
			roll for the influence check, the target character's mind attribute is treated
			as if it were zero. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you must discard the
			character card you revealed. If such an influence check is successful, the
			target character and his non-follower cards are discarded and the revealed
			character card may be immediately played (appearing at the same site). In
			order to play this character, you must have enough unused general influence
			to control him or an influencing character at the same site must have enough
			direct influence.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>: If you reveal an identical character
			in order to nullify the target character's mind attribute for an influence
			check, you must discard that character if you do not play him.</i><br><br><b>Example</b>:
			Jessica and Jason each have one company organized as follows:<br>
			<b>Jessica's General Influence (- ·20) </b><br>
			</font></p><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			Elladan (4·0)<br>
			Legolas (6·2+2)<br>
				</font><ul><font face="Garamond">Inglorion (4·0) <br></font></ul>
<font face="Garamond">			</font></ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<b>Pallando</b> (- ·10)<br>
			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			Celeborn (6·1)<br>
			Elrohir (4·0) <br>
			</font></ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<br>
			<b>Jason's General Influence (- ·20)</b><br>
			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			Théoden (6·3)<br>
			 Faramir (5·1)<br>
			 Imrahil (6·2)<br>
			</font></ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<b>Radagast</b> (- ·10)<br>
			</font><ul><font face="Garamond">Beorn (7·2)<br></font></ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<br>
			Jessica moves her company to the same site as Jason's company. During her
			site phase, Pallando attempts to influence Faramir. Jessica has 4 unused
			general influence, Jason has 3 unused general influence, and Pallando has
			6 unused direct influence. Jessica rolls 2D6 and gets a 8, while Jason rolls
			2D6 and gets a 7. So the modified result of the influence check is 4 = 8
			(Jessica's roll) + 6 (Pallando's unused direct influence) - 3 (Jason's unused
			general influence) - 7 (Jason's roll). This result is not greater than Faramir's
			mind attribute of 5, so Faramir is not influenced and remains in play. If
			Jessica had rolled a 10 or higher, Faramir would have been discarded.<br>
			If Jessica had revealed a Faramir card from her hand before the rolls were
			made, his mind attribute would have been zero for the purposes of this roll.
			In this case, the influence check would have been successful-Jason would
			have discarded his Faramir card and Jessica would have played her Faramir
			card. He must be played as Pallando's follower because she only has 4 unused
			general influence.<br>
			In the case in which Faramir is influenced, Jessica should not celebrate
			too much. During his turn, Jason can shift Beorn to control by general influence
			and then use Radagast's 10 unused general influence points to attempt to
			influence one of Jessica's characters.<br><b>Influencing an Opponent's Ally</b><br>
			To influence an opponent's ally, you must make an influence check as outlined
			above. However, the following exceptions apply:

			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Instead of the controlling character's mind attribute, the influence
			check uses the ally's mind attribute. </li>
			<li>The result is also modified by the "unused direct influence"
			of the character controlling the ally. </li>
			<li>Revealing an identical ally card reduces the ally's mind attribute
			to 0 and allows you to play the card if the influence check is successful.
			</li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b>Influencing an Opponent's Follower</b><br>
			To influence an opponent's follower, you must make an influence check as
			outlined above. However, the result is also modified by subtracting the
			"unused direct influence" of the follower's controlling character.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Influencing an Opponent's Faction</b><br>
			To influence an opponent's faction, you must make an influence check as
			outlined above. However, the following exceptions apply: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Instead of a mind attribute, the influence check uses the value usually
			required to bring the faction into play (as given on the faction's card).
			</li>
			<li>The influence check is modified by any of the faction's applicable
			"Standard Modifications" (as given on the faction's card). </li>
			<li>Revealing an identical faction card reduces the the value usually required
			to bring the faction into play to zero and allows you to play that card
			if the influence check is successful. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">You may only influence an opponent's factions if the influencing character
			is at the site where the faction was played.<br>
			<b><br>
			Influencing an Opponent's Item</b><br>
			To influence an opponent's item, you must make an influence check as outlined
			above. However, the following exceptions apply: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>· The mind attribute of the character controlling the item is
			used. </li>
			<li>· The result is also modified by subtracting the "unused
			direct influence" of the item's controlling character. </li>
			<li>· You must reveal an identical item card in order to make an influence
			attempt on an item (i.e., you are attempting to convince the controlling
			character that the item would be more useful to the cause of the Free Peoples
			in your hands). If the influence check is successful, you may play your
			card with the character that made the influence check-if you choose not
			to play the item, discard it. </li>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br><i>Clarification: The unused direct influence for an influence check

			<font align="CENTER" size="+1">10 · Playing and Drawing Cards</font>

			</font><p><font face="Garamond">There are several Standard Rules changes involving playing cards.<br>
			<br>
			<b>LIMITS ON DRAWING CARDS </b><br>
			During your turn, you may draw cards based on one of your moving companies
			only if the company contains a Wizard or at least one character with a mind
			attribute of three or more.<br>
			<br>
			<b>PLACING A CARD ON-GUARD [Old Rule]</b><br>
			During the movement/hazard phase of your opponent's turn, you may place
			one card on-guard for each of your opponent's companies. This card is played
			face down next to the company's new site or next to its current site if
			it did not move. Any card can be placed on-guard (i.e., it does not have
			to be a hazard, you can bluff). Such a card does count against the hazard
			limit for the company it is placed on. <br>
			The card will remain on that site until one of the following occurs: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>· The company decides to face the site's automatic-attack. If
			the on-guard card is a hazard creature keyed to the company's site or a
			hazard that can modify the automatic-attack, it may be revealed before
			the automatic-attack is resolved. If it is a hazard creature, it will attack
			after the automatic-attack is resolved. </li>
			<li>· The company plays a card keyed to the site. If the on-guard
			card is a non-creature hazard, it may be revealed if it is a hazard that
			directly affects the company or a character in the company (e.g., a hazard
			that forces all characters to make a corruption check). </li>
			<li>· Otherwise, return the card to your hand at the end of the site
			phase. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">In the first two cases, the card is handled as if it had been played
			during the movement-hazard phase (i.e., short-events are discarded, long-events
			last until your opponent's next long-event phase, etc.).<br>
			</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><a name="OnGuard"></a><b>PLACING A CARD ON-GUARD [Revised Rule]</b></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">An often confusing point is when and if certain hazards can be revealed
			as on-guard cards. There are two cases when a face down card may be revealed,
			and, thusly, affect an opponent's company: 1) when the company announces
			it will face a site's automatic-attacks (before the automatic-attack is
			itself faced), and 2) when the company plays a card keyed to the site. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">For <b>case #1</b>, it is essential to realize that if the site has no
			automatic-attacks (like all normally occuring Free-holds), you cannot reveal
			an on-guard card according to this criterium. Additionally, an event that
			modifies the prowess of a character may not be revealed--only hazards that
			modify an automatic-attack itself can be. A creature revealed as an on-guard
			card is not considered an automatic-attack--it is considered a hazard creature
			attack.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">For <b>case #2</b>, specifically, you may reveal an on-guard card in
			the same chain of effects in response to the play (declaration thereof)
			of any item, faction, ally, or other card that potentially taps the site.
			Successfully testing for and playing a ring special item does not count!
			You may reveal an on-guard card in response to the declaration of an influence
			attempt on a faction that only has an effect if the attempt would be successful
			(e.g., Lure of Power). Also, in the case of a faction, you may reveal an
			on-guard card that affects the actual influence attempt.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Additionally, the on-guard card may only be revealed if it affects the
			company or a character in the company that site phase--this clarification
			is actually looser than the rule printed on page page 61 of the METW Unlimited
			Rulesbook. This rule did state the on-guard card may only be revealed if
			it directly affected the company. Only declared or on-going cards and effects
			can be considered when determining the validy of revealing an on-guard card--cards
			in your hand, your opponent's hand, play deck, discard pile, etc. cannot
			be considered and potential effects that have not been triggered cannot
			be considered. An on-guard card may not be revealed if it has an effect
			that is meaningless during a company's site phase.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b>Example</b></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">As an example of how this requirement is looser now, Balance of Things
			may be revealed as an on-guard card so long as at least one character in
			the company, during whose site phase Balance of Things is revealed, carries
			at least one corruption source.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b>Example</b></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">Balrog of Moria could be revealed when a company chooses to face the
			automatic-attacks at Moria (Balrog modifies Moria's automatic-attacks).
			However, it could not be revealed in response to the play of an item at
			Moria because Balrog in no way can affect the company for the rest of the
			site phase (unless for some reason the company is fated to face the automatic-attacks
			again).</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">A corruption card can be revealed as an on-guard card (so long as it
			otherwise is legal)--because a character in the company is affected. A card
			that changes the company's site type cannot be revealed unless this has
			some obvious effect on the company that site phase. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">1) A card cannot be revealed that returns a company to its site of origin.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">2) A card cannot be revealed that taps a company's site.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">3) A card cannot be revealed that potentially removes a character from
			a company.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">4) A card cannot be revealed that forces a company to do nothing during
			its site phase. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">5) A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be revealed
			(so long as it otherwise is legal). </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">6) Traitor cannot be revealed. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">7) Troll-purse (from Middle-earth: Dark Minions) can be revealed.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">The spirit of the on-guard card is to represent a hazard threat that
			existed during a company's movement/hazard phase, but of which the company
			was not aware. The actual rule that portrays this spirit is: an on-guard
			may only be revealed if it could have also been played during the movement/hazard
			phase--this is a slight modification from the rule printed on page page
			61 of the METW Unlimited Rulesbook. Practically, this means all targets
			of the card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order
			for the card to be revealed. </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">IMPORTANT: A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though
			it were both declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects
			during which it was revealed. For example, if a Greed is played in reponse
			to the play of an item, it is considered to be in effect immediately prior
			to the play of item. Thus, Greed would cause corruption checks following
			the play of the item.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><br></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond"><b>Example</b></font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">As a final, encompassing example of the <b>NEW</b> on-guard rules, Muster
			Disperses cannot be revealed as an on-guard card for three reasons.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">1) Muster Disperses cannot target a faction played during the site phase
			during which it would be revealed because this target did not exist during
			the movement/hazard phase.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">2) Muster Disperses cannot target a faction already in play at the start
			of the site phase because it would not affect a company or a character in
			the company.</font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">3) Muster Disperses cannot target a faction played during the site phase
			during which it would be revealed because this target does not exist when
			Muster Disperses would be revealed. A card can only be revealed in the same
			chain of effects as the play of a resource that potentially taps the site,
			and this resource actually is not resolved and cannot be targetted at that
			point.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Example</b>: After visiting Thranduil's Halls, Jessica's company
			moves to The Lonely Mountain. During her movement/hazard phase, Jason places
			a card on-guard. The card is Awaken Denizens, but Jessica does not know
			that. This card doubles the # of strikes for an automatic-attack at a Ruins
			&amp; Lairs site.<br>
			During her site phase, Jessica states that her company will face The Lonely
			Mountain's automatic-attack (a Dragon, 1 strike with a prowess of 14). Jason
			reveals his on-guard card and the automatic-attack becomes 2 strikes with
			a prowess of 14 each. Jessica's company must face this attack (it may be
			canceled.<br>
			Suppose Jason had placed a Cave Drake on-guard. Then Jessica's company would
			have to face the automatic-attack and then the Cave Drake.<br>
			Suppose Jason had placed a Weariness of the Heart on-guard. Then, if Jessica's
			company successfully faced the automatic-attack and played an item, Jason
			could reveal the Weariness of the Heart to force any one character in the
			company to make a corruption check.<br><b>Dice Roll Timing</b><br>
			Before a roll is made for combat or a check, cards may be played that will
			modify the result of the roll. However, once the roll is actually made,
			no further cards may be played that modify the dice roll result. This modified
			result is used to determine effects of the combat or check before any other
			actions are taken. When the effects of a dice roll require other actions
			(e.g., a successful strike requires a body check) those actions become the
			initial actions (any further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects
			after the roll.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Timing Rules</b><br>
			You and your opponent may both want to perform actions at the same time
			or actions that are sequenced with respect to other actions. This can happen
			during your movement/hazard phase (or during your site phase if your opponent
			has a card on-guard). Such actions almost always include playing a card,
			tapping a card already in play, and revealing an on-guard card. <br>
			Your opponent may always declare an action in response before your action
			is resolved. Then, you may respond to his action, and he can respond to
			your second action, and so on until neither player can (or wants to) perform
			an action.<br>
			You must give your opponent a chance to respond to every action, and vice
			versa. If you perform an action and move on to another action without giving
			your opponent a chance to respond, you must "backup" if he indicates
			that he wants to respond.<br>
			Such a series of declared actions is called a chain of effects. You always
			have the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during
			your turn. The actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time
			from last declared to first declared (i.e., the last declared action is
			resolved first, then the second to the last, etc.). <br>
			You may follow one of your declared actions with another of your declared
			actions in the same chain of effects, so long as you give your opponent
			a chance to respond to first action. <br>
			An action in a chain of effects is negated if the conditions required to
			perform it are negated by another action that is resolved before it in the
			chain of effects.<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Timing Example</b>: You play Weariness of the Heart on Bilbo to force
			him to make a corruption check. Your opponent taps Frodo (2nd action in
			this chain of effects) to give Bilbo +1 to this check. You play Call of
			Home on Bilbo (3rd action), which forces Bilbo to make a successful roll
			or return to his owner's hand. Finally, your opponent plays Tookish Blood
			on Bilbo. This cancels any effect for the rest of the turn which would discard
			Bilbo or send him to his owner's hand. Now you resolve actions from last
			to first: </font></p>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><ul>
<font face="Garamond">			<li>Tookish Blood takes effect. </li>
			<li>Call of Home takes effect, but Tookish Blood negates any effect it
			would have. </li>
			<li>Frodo gives +1 to Bilbo's corruption check (an action can target a
			dice-rolling action that was declared earlier in the same chain of effects,
			even though the dice-rolling action has not taken effect). </li>
			<li>Bilbo makes his corruption check-he rolls the dice adding +1 to his
			roll because of Frodo's help (other modifications not discussed here).
			Tookish Blood cancels any result of this corruption check that would discard
			Bilbo. </li>
			</font></ul>

<font face="Garamond">			</font><p><font face="Garamond">If your opponent had played Tookish Blood on Bilbo after his dice roll,
			i.e. after this chain of effects was resolved, it would not have affected
			your Call of Home nor Bilbo's corruption check. Tookish Blood only cancels
			those actions that occur during the rest of the turn, and not prior actions.<br>
			Consider if Tookish Blood had not been played and if you played Call of
			Home on Frodo. First Frodo rolls for Call of Home when resolving the chain.
			If he fails this check, Frodo goes back to your opponent's hand. The 2nd
			action in the chain would then be negated because the conditions required
			to perform it, namely Frodo being in Bilbo's company, were negated by your
			Call of Home.<br> <br>
